## About Weather App

This app is built with Laravel with Vue + TailwindCss 

The idea of the design and theme is dynamic based on what weather temperature on any places. 
The app is very easy to use, user friendly and developed by the coder with passion and art.

## API

For weather forecast:
OpenWeatherMap API - https://api.openweathermap.org

For place information:
GeoAPIFY API - https://api.geoapify.com

Note!
Supposedly, Foursquare Search Venue API should be use to get place information.
Unfortunately, the api doesn`t work. Before using the api, testing are made through:

* Postman
* In documentation
* Research - forums
* Code

And fails.
In order to achieve the functionality needed, it need some improvisation and use an alternate api.

## Development Time

The app completed within 16 hours or below excluding setup and api test.
Most of the time consume was setup and api test.
